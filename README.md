## Description
  If you are in the market for any type of vehicle (drivaeble or not!), TinLizzie is the place for you! This website allows you to browse vehicles whether you are a registered user or not, and provides the ability to sell your car if you are a registered user. This project features a dynamic front end and MySQL backend, with the use of handlebars to simplify the communication between the two. The deployed application can be found on Heroku.
